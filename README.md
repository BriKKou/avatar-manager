Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to
maintain backward compatibility, Crayon will be maintained under the Semantic
Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and
  patch).
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and
  resets the patch).
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch.
